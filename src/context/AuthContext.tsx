// src/context/AuthContext.tsx
// This file is intentionally left blank or with minimal content
// as Firebase Authentication has been removed from the application.

// console.log("Firebase AuthContext has been removed from this application.");

// You can delete this file if it's no longer imported anywhere.
// If other parts of the app still expect some exports (e.g. for conditional logic),
// you might provide dummy exports like:
// export const useAuth = () => ({ user: null, loading: false, isAdmin: false, signInWithEmailPassword: async () => {}, signUpWithEmailPassword: async () => {}, signOut: async () => {} });
// export const AuthProvider = ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) => <>{children}</>;

// For a clean removal, ensure no other files import from here.
// Specifically, src/app/layout.tsx should no longer wrap children with AuthProvider.
